CS 2340 MARTA Simulation Project

This project was done for my CS 2340 Objects and Design course that I took at Georgia Tech during Summer 2018.

Essentially, the application takes in bus data in the form of a .csv, and outputs an interactive map that displays the buses, routes, and stops.

Contributing members to this project include Austin Miles, Inae Park, and Chris Johnson.
